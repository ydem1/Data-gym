        <div class="title_plans">Annual plan:($600.00)
            <p>
                This plan is a yearly subscription that 
                allows the client to pay for a full year 
                of membership upfront. It typically offers
                a discounted rate compared to paying on a 
                monthly basis and is ideal for clients who
                are committed to using the facility consistently
                throughout the year.

        <div class="title_plans">Quarterly plan:($200.00)
            <p>
                This plan is a three-month subscription 
                that allows the client to pay for a 
                quarter of the year upfront. It is a 
                good option for clients who are unsure 
                of their long-term commitment to the facility 
                but still want to save money compared to paying 
                on a monthly basis.

        <div class="title_plans">Monthly plan:($100.00)
            <p>
                This plan is a monthly subscription that allows 
                the client to pay for their membership on a month-to-month 
                basis. It is ideal for clients who want the flexibility to 
                cancel or pause their membership at any time without committing
                to a longer term plan.
